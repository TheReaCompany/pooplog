== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does speed matter? =

Speed is among the most significant success factors web sites face. In fact, your blog's speed directly affects your income (revenue) &mdash; it's a fact. Some high traffic sites conducted some research and uncovered the following:

* Google.com: +500 ms (speed decrease) -> -20% traffic loss [[1](http://home.blarg.net/~glinden/StanfordDataMining.2006-11-29.ppt)]
* Yahoo.com: +400 ms (speed decrease) -> -5-9% full-page traffic loss (visitor left before the page finished loading) [[2](http://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/yslow-20-presentation)]
* Amazon.com: +100 ms (speed decrease) -> -1% sales loss [[1](http://home.blarg.net/~glinden/StanfordDataMining.2006-11-29.ppt)]

A thousandth of a second is not a long time, yet the impact is quite significant. Even if you're not a large company (or just hope to become one), a loss is still a loss. However, there is a solution to this problem, take advantage.

In the near future search engines themselves will weigh the performance of web sites as factors in their ranking algorithms. Search engine's have the goal of providing users with the best user experience, so speed is definitely a factor.

= Why is W3 Total Cache better than other cache plugins? =

Most of the popular cache plugins available do a great job and serve their purpose very well. Our plugin remedies numerous performance reducing aspects of any web site going far beyond merely reducing CPU usage (load) and bandwidth consumption for HTML pages alone. Equally important, the plugin requires no theme modifications, modifications to your .htaccess (mod_rewrite rules) or programming compromises to reap the benefits. Setup is easy.

= I've never heard of any of this stuff; my blog is fine, no one complains about the speed. Why should I install this? =

Rarely do readers take the time to complain. They typically just stop browsing earlier than you'd prefer and may not return altogether. It's in every web site owner's best interest is to make sure that the performance of your blog is not hindering its success.

= And how many years of university do I need to use this thing? =

-4 - That's right; a youngster in junior high school can get started with this plugin. Seriously, if you did your own WordPress install or have ever installed a plugin before you're in good shape. If you need help, let us know or perhaps we'll make some videos or the like.

= Which WordPress versions are supported? =

To use all features in the suite, a minimum of version WordPress 2.5 with PHP 5 is required. Earlier versions will benefit from our Media Library Importer to get them back on the upgrade path and into a CDN of their choosing.

= Will the plugin interfere with other plugins or widgets? =

No, on the contrary if you use the minify settings you will improve their performance by several times.

= Does this plugin work with WordPress MU? =

Indeed it does.

= Does this plugin work with BuddyPress (bbPress)? =

Not sure, we'll get to that soon.

= What about comments? Does the plugin slow down the rate at which comments appear? =

On the contrary, as with any other action a user can perform on a site, faster performance will encourage more of it. The cache is so quickly rebuilt in memory that it's no trouble to show visitors the most current version of a post that's experiencing Digg, Slashdot, Drudge Report, Yahoo Buzz or Twitter effect.

= Who do you recommend as a CDN (Content Delivery Network) provider? =

That depends on how you use your blog and where most of your readers read your blog (regionally). Here's a short list:

* [MaxCDN](http://www.maxcdn.com/)
* [Rackspace Cloud Files](http://www.rackspacecloud.com/cloud_hosting_products/files)
* [Cotendo](http://www.cotendo.com/)
* [VPS NET](https://vps.net/cdn-signup)
* [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) &amp; [Amazon Cloudfront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
* [NetDNA](http://www.netdna.com/)
* [EdgeCast](http://www.edgecast.com/)
* [Akamai](http://www.akamai.com/)
* [Limelight Networks](http://www.limelightnetworks.com/)
* [SimpleCDN](http://www.simplecdn.com/)
* [Voxel](http://www.voxel.net/products-services/voxcast-cdn)

= How do I configure Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon CloudFront as my CDN? =

First [create an S3 account](http://aws.amazon.com/). Next, you need to obtain your "Access key" and "Secret key" from the "Access Credentials" section of the "[Security Credentials](http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key)" page of "My Account." Make sure the status is "active." Next, make sure that "Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)" is the selected type of CDN on the General Settings tab (if not change the setting and save the changes). Now on the CDN Settings tab enter your "Access key," "Secret key" and create a bucket. Click the "Test S3 Upload" button and make sure that the test is successful, if not check your settings and try again.

Save your settings. Make sure that you export your media library, upload your wp-includes (WordPress core files) theme files, and custom files if you wish to host each of those with AWS. Unless you wish to use CloudFront, you're almost done, skip to the next paragraph if you're using CloudFront. Just go to the General Settings tab and click the checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect.

To use CloudFront, perform all of the steps above, except select the "Amazon CloudFront" CDN type in the CDN section of the General Settings tab. Proceed to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) and create a new distribution: select the S3 Bucket you created earlier as the "Origin," enter a [CNAME](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?CNAMEs.html) if you wish to add one to your DNS Zone. Make sure that "Distribution Status" is enabled and "State" is deployed. Now on CDN Settings tab of the plugin, copy the subdomain found in the AWS Management Console and enter the CNAME used for the distribution in the "CNAME" field.

Now go to the General Settings tab and click the checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect.

= How do I use an Origin Pull (Mirror) CDN? =
Login to your CDN providers control panel or account management area. Following any set up steps they provide, create a new "pull zone" or "bucket" for your site's domain name. If there's a set up wizard or any troubleshooting tips your provider offers, be sure to review them. In the CDN Settings tab of the plugin, enter the hostname your CDN provider provided in the "replace default hostname with" field. You should always do a quick check by opening a test file from the CDN hostname, e.g. http://cdn.domain.com/favicon.ico. Troubleshoot with yoru CDN provider until this test is successful.

Now go to the General Settings tab and click the checkbox and save the settings to enable CDN functionality and empty the cache for the changes to take effect.

= What if I don't want to work with a CDN right now, is there any other use for this feature? =

Yes! You can take advantage of the [pipelining](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/http/pipelining-faq.html) support in some browsers by creating a sub-domain for the static content for your site. So you could select the "Origin Push / Self-hosted" method of the General Settings tab. Create static.domain.com on your server (and update your DNS zone) and then specify the FTP details for it in the plugin configuration panel and you're done. If you disable the scripting options on your server you'll find that your server will actually respond slightly faster from that sub-domain because it's just sending files and not processing them.

= I don't understand what a CDN has to do with caching, that's completely different, no? =

Technically no, a CDN is a high performance cache that stores static assets (your theme files, media library etc) in various locations throughout the world in order to provide low latency access to them by readers in those regions. So indeed a CDN is a high performance cache, many of which actually store your frequently requested assets in memory for fastest possible response.

= But even Matt Mullenweg doesn't agree that additional caching is so important, why bother? =

You're right, [Matt did say that](http://ma.tt/2008/03/wordpress-is-open-source/#comment-439787). However, this plugin provides more than just "caching". Because he is correct, the web is dynamic and must remain so. But as we explain throughout this FAQ, our goal is to improve the performance of any blog and we deliver. Furthermore, the techniques we use, are well documented from past [WordCamp presentations](http://www.slideshare.net/bazza/high-performance-wordpress), we simply have combined them in a way that we have found stands up to the highest traffic situations.

= Why would I want to cache my feeds? =

We feel that caching objects after the first request and checking for updates before responding subsequent requests (which is kind of how web browsers work too) creates more opportunities for interesting applications and mashups where the blogosphere doesn't require institutional investment to be able to handle developers making hundreds of requests every day the same way we use Google, Twitter and Facebook (for example) APIs today. Think about it, even when major search engines crawl your site, they have to be "gentle" so they don't bring it down, let's turn the paradigm around so that every blog can deliver content in real-time in various ways.

= Will this plugin speed up WP Admin? =

Yes, indirectly - if you have a lot of bloggers working with you, you will find that it feels like you have a server dedicated only to WP Admin once this plugin is enabled; the result, increased productivity.

= Which web servers do you support? =

We are aware of no incompatibilities with [apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) 1.3+, [IIS](http://www.iis.net/) 5+ or [litespeed](http://litespeedtech.com/products/webserver/overview/) 4.0.2+. If there's a web server you feel we should be actively testing (e.g. [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/)), we're [interested in hearing](http://www.w3-edge.com/contact/).

= Is this plugin server cluster and load balancer friendly? =

Yes, built from the ground up with scale and current hosting paradigms in mind.

= I don't have time to deal with this, but I know I need it. Will you help me? =

Yes! Please [reach out to us](http://www.w3-edge.com/contact/) and we'll get you acclimated so you can "set it and forget it."

= Is this plugin comptatible with GD Star Rating? =

Yes. Follow these steps:

1. Enable dynamic loading of ratings by checking GD Star Rating -> Settings -> Features "Cache support option"
1. If Database cache enabled in W3 Total Cache add "wp_gdsr" to "Ignored query stems" option on the Database Cache settings tab, otherwise ratings will not updated after voting
1. Empty all caches

= I see garbage characters instead of the normal web site, what's going on here? =

If a theme or it's files use the call php_flush() or function flush() that will interfere with the plugins normal operation; making the plugin send cached files before essential operations have finished. The flush() call is no longer necessary and should be removed.

= How do I cache only the home page? =

Add `/.+` to page cache "Never cache the following pages" option on the page cache settings tab.

= I'm getting blank pages or 500 error codes when trying to upgrade on WordPress MU =

First, make sure the plugin is not active (disabled) site-wide. Then make sure it's deactivated site-wide. Now you should be able to successful upgrade without breaking your site.

= What is the purpose of the "Media Library Import" tool and how do I use it? =

The media library import tool is for old or "messy" WordPress installations that have attachments (images etc in posts or pages) scattered about the web server or "hot linked" to 3rd party sites instead of properly using the media library.

The tool will scan your posts and pages for the cases above and copy them to your media library, update your posts to use the link addresses and produce a .htaccess file containing the list of of permanent redirects, so search engines can find the files in their new location.

You should backup your database before performing this operation.

= How do I find the JS and CSS to optimize (minify) them with this plugin? =

View your page source in your browser and search for any `<style>`, `<link>` or `<script>` tags that contain external CSS or JS files and one by one add them to the minify settings page. Do not include any CSS in conditional statements (unless you know what you are doing) like:

`<!--[if lte IE 8]><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/wp-content/themes/default/lte.css" media="screen,projection" /><![endif]-->`

The plugin will concatenate, minify, HTTP compress and check for updates to these files automatically from now on. If you have any CSS or JS that are inline consider making them external files so that you can use them with minify.

= This is too good to be true, how can I test the results? =
You will be able to see it instantly on each page load, but for tangible metrics, consider the following tools:

* [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) + [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) + [Yahoo! YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/)

== Installation ==

1. Disable and remove any other caching plugin you may be using &mdash; most plugins have uninstall procedures you can follow. Make sure wp-content/ has 777 permissions before proceeding, e.g.: `# chmod 777 /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/wp-content/` using your web hosting control panel or your SSH account.
1. Login as an administrator to your WordPress Admin account. Using the "Add New" menu item under the "Plugins" section of the navigation, you can either search for: w3 total cache or if you've downloaded the plugin already, click the "Upload" link, find the .zip file you download and then click "Install Now". Or you can unzip and FTP upload the plugin to your plugins directory (wp-content/plugins/). In either case, when done wp-content/plugins/w3-total-cache/ should exist.
1. Ensure that wp-config.php (typically found in the root directory) contains the statement: `define('WP_CACHE', true);` If you previously used a caching plugin, this statement is likely to exist already.
1. Locate and activate the plugin on the "Plugins" page. Page and database caching will now automatically be running with their default settings. Set the permissions of wp-content back to 755, e.g.: `# chmod 755 /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/wp-content/`
1. Now click the "Settings" link to proceed to the "General Settings" tab and select your caching methods for page, database and minify. In most cases, "disk enhanced" mode for page cache, "disk" mode for minify and "disk" mode for database caching are "good" settings.
1. Optional: On the "Minify Settings" tab all of the recommended settings are preset. View your site's HTML source and search for .css and .js files and then specify any CSS and JS files in the respective section. In the case of JS files you can (optionally) specify the type and location of the embedding using the drop down menu. See the plugin's FAQ for more information on usage.
1. Optional: If you already have a content delivery network (CDN) provider, proceed to the "CDN Settings" tab and populate the fields and set your preferences. If you do not use the Media Library, you will need to import your images etc into the default locations. Use the Media Library Import Tool on the CDN Setting tab to perform this task. If you do not have a CDN provider, you can still improve your site's performance using the "Self-hosted" method. On your own server, create a subdomain and matching DNS Zone record; e.g. static.domain.com and configure FTP options on the CDN tab accordingly. Be sure to FTP upload the appropriate files, using the available upload buttons.
1. You're done! Get back to blogging!
